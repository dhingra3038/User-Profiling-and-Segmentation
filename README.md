# User-Profiling-and-Segmentation
This project involves creating user profiles and segmenting users based on their behavioral data, such as time spent online, interaction rates, and demographic information. The goal is to identify distinct user groups that share similar characteristics, which can be used for targeted marketing, personalization, or customer analysis.

Project Overview:

The project is built in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, with the following key steps:

Data Collection and Preparation: The dataset includes user activity metrics such as time spent online (weekday and weekend), click-through rates (CTR), likes and reactions, and demographic data (age, gender, income level).

Feature Engineering: We preprocess the data, handling both numerical and categorical features, using scaling and encoding techniques.

Clustering Analysis: KMeans clustering is applied to segment users into distinct groups based on their online behavior and demographic attributes.

Profiling Users: Each cluster is analyzed to generate meaningful profiles, giving insights into the behavior patterns of different user segments.

Visualization: Radar charts and other plots are used to visually represent the characteristics of each user segment.

Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language for the project.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive code development and visualization.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For clustering (KMeans), scaling, and encoding features.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data and clustering results.


Use Cases:
Marketing Personalization: Tailoring offers and content for different user segments.
Customer Analytics: Understanding user groups and their behaviors to improve user retention.
Product Recommendations: Segmenting users to provide personalized product recommendations.


Future Enhancements:
Add more sophisticated clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering).
Include additional user data to create more detailed profiles.
Improve the visualization of clusters using more advanced plotting libraries.
